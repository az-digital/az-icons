# Arizona Icons
Find more detailed information on how to use `az-icons` within the [Arizona
Bootstrap Docs](https://digital.arizona.edu/arizona-bootstrap/docs/2.0/icons/).
## Download
Download Arizona Icons to get the compiled CSS and font files, source code, or
include it with your favorite package managers like npm, RubyGems, and more.

### Source Files
Compile Arizona Icons with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source
CSS, SVG, PNG, and font files. This option requires some additional tooling.

### Arizona Digital CDN
Skip the download with the Arizona Digital CDN to deliver a cached version of
Arizona Iconsâ€™s CSS and font files to your project.

When choosing which version to include in your project, take these three choices
into account:

**Stable** version: Each tagged release has a permanent CDN link. This version
has to be upgraded on your project manually.
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.digital.arizona.edu/lib/az-icons/1.0.0/az-icons-styles.css" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

**Latest** tagged version: The contents of this CDN link update automatically
every time we tag a release of `az-icons`. While there is some risk involved
with this link (for example, the icons could randomly break on your site), the
up-side is that you get access to new icons and upgrades to performance on each
release automatically. It's safe to use on production sites. Please
[report bugs to the AZ Digital team](https://github.com/az-digital/az-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md).
```

```

**Main** version: Latest dev version. This is the tip of the main branch of
AZ Icons. Please do not use on production unless you are following the AZ
Icons project closely. Please [report bugs to the AZ Digital team](https://github.com/az-digital/az-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md).
